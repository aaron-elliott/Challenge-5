    "The CTO of the credit union is impressed with your work on these planning tools but wonders if 30 years is a long time to wait until retirement. So, your next task is to adjust the retirement portfolio and run a new Monte Carlo simulation to find out if the changes will allow members to retire earlier.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Forecast the cumulative returns for 10 years from now. Because of the shortened investment horizon (30 years to 10 years), the portfolio needs to invest more heavily in the riskier asset&mdash;that is, stock&mdash;to help accumulate wealth for retirement. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjust the weights of the retirement portfolio so that the composition for the Monte Carlo simulation consists of 20% bonds and 80% stocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the simulation over 500 samples, and use the same data that the API call to Alpaca generated.\n",
